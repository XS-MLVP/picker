> A codegen tool for chip verification, which can provide C++/Python interfaces for the RTL designs.

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Introduction

Picker is a chip verification auxiliary tool. There are two functions: the first is aimed at encapsulating RTL design verification modules (.v/.scala/.sv) and exposing Pin-Level operations through other programming languages, with plans to support automated Transaction-Level primitive generation in the future. the second is pack uvm transaction as a uvm agent and python class, you can use them and xcomm tool to enable communication between UVM and Python.

Other programming languages include interfaces for C++ (natively supported), Python (supported), Java (supported), Scala (in progress), and Golang (in progress).

This auxiliary tool allows users to perform chip UT verification based on existing software testing frameworks, such as pytest, junit, TestNG, go test, etc.

The advantages of verifying with Picker include:

1. No leakage of RTL design. After conversion by Picker, the original design files (.v) are transformed into binary files (.so), allowing for verification without the original design files and preventing verifiers from accessing the RTL source code.
2. Reduced compilation time. When the DUT (Design Under Test) is stable, it only needs to be compiled once (packaged into .so).
3. Broad user base. The provided programming interfaces cover developers of different languages (traditional IC verification only uses System Verilog).
4. Rich software ecosystem. It can utilize ecosystems like Python3, Java, Golang, etc.
5. Automate the packaging of UVM transactions to enable communication between UVM and Python.

Currently, Picker supports the following backend RTL simulators:

1. Verilator
2. Synopsys VCS

## How to Use

### Dependency Installation

1. [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (>=3.11)
2. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (needs to support C++20, at least version 10, **recommended version 11 or above**)
3. [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>=3.8)
4. [Verilator](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html#git-quick-install) (**==4.218**)
5. [Verible Verilog Format](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible) (>=0.0-3428-gcfcbb82b)
6. [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) (>=**4.2.0**, multi-language support)

> Please ensure that the path to tools like `verible-verilog-format` is added to the environment variable `$PATH` for direct command-line invocation.

### Source Code Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XS-MLVP/picker.git
cd picker
make init
```

### Build and Install

```bash
cd picker
make
sudo -E make install
```

> The default installation path is `/usr/local`, with binary files placed in `/usr/local/bin` and template files in `/usr/local/share/picker`.  
> The installation will automatically install the `xspcomm` base library (https://github.com/XS-MLVP/xcomm), which is used to encapsulate the basic types of `RTL` modules, located at `/usr/local/lib/libxspcomm.so`. **You may need to manually set the link directory parameters (-L) during compilation.**   
> Additionally, if Python support is enabled (default), the `xspcomm` Python package will also be installed, located at `/usr/local/share/picker/python/xspcomm/`.  

After installation, execute the `picker` command to except the flow output:

```
XDut Generate. 
Convert DUT(*.v/*.sv) to C++ DUT libs.

```

### Installation Test

Now picker has two subcommands: pack and export. You can run the following commands to check their output:

```bash
Export RTL Projects Sources as Software libraries such as C++/Python Usage: picker
